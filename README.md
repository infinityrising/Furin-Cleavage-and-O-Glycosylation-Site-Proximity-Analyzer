# Furin Cleavage and O-Glycosylation Site Proximity Analyzer

This Python 3 algorithm takes an input of three files and outputs a single file of results. The input files are a protein alignment (.fasta), PiTau furin cleavage prediction site data (.txt), and NetOGlyc4.0 results (.txt). This program will crunch the numbers across all three of these files and generate an Excel spreadsheet (.csv) that sheds light on whether O-glycosylation sites are in close proximity to predicted furin cleavage sites.
